## Key Findings

### Impact of Informality on Economic Outcomes

1. **Convergence**: Models with low informality (0.1) show 98.0% convergence rate vs 90.0% for high informality (0.7).

2. **Inflation Control**: Low informality scenarios achieve average inflation of 0.0145 compared to 0.0145 in high informality scenarios.

3. **Economic Stability**: Inflation volatility increases from 0.0025 (low informality) to 0.0026 (high informality).

4. **Credit Access**: The credit access gap widens from 0.5298 to 0.5286 as informality increases.

## Detailed Results by Informality Rate

| Informality Rate | Convergence Rate | Avg Inflation | Inflation Volatility | Credit Gap | Formal Production % |
|------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|------------|--------------------|
| 0.1 | 98.0% | 0.0145 | 0.0025 | 0.5298 | 97.1% |
| 0.2 | 98.0% | 0.0145 | 0.0026 | 0.5320 | 93.5% |
| 0.3 | 96.0% | 0.0149 | 0.0025 | 0.5260 | 89.5% |
| 0.4 | 99.0% | 0.0142 | 0.0026 | 0.5353 | 84.6% |
| 0.5 | 98.0% | 0.0138 | 0.0027 | 0.5349 | 78.7% |
| 0.6 | 96.0% | 0.0142 | 0.0027 | 0.5341 | 70.8% |
| 0.7 | 90.0% | 0.0145 | 0.0026 | 0.5286 | 62.4% |
| 0.8 | 87.0% | 0.0144 | 0.0026 | 0.5323 | 49.2% |

## Analysis by Informality Regime

| Regime | Simulations | Convergence Rate | Avg Inflation | Policy Effectiveness |
|--------|-------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| High | 300 | 91.0% | 0.0144 | 0.0056 |
| Low | 200 | 98.0% | 0.0145 | 0.0055 |
| Medium | 300 | 97.7% | 0.0143 | 0.0057 |

## Policy Implications

1. **Monetary Policy Effectiveness**: Higher levels of informality appear to reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy, as evidenced by lower convergence rates and higher inflation volatility.

2. **Credit Channel**: The widening credit access gap in high informality scenarios suggests that informal sectors have limited access to formal credit markets, potentially reducing monetary policy transmission.

3. **Economic Stability**: Economies with higher informality rates show greater macroeconomic instability, making inflation targeting more challenging.

4. **Structural Reforms**: The results suggest that reducing informality through structural reforms could enhance monetary policy effectiveness and economic stability.
